                <h2>Problem statement: Campus Transportation</h2>
                <p>
                    The transportation provided by the university or lack thereof is not enough for the everyday college student. The buses either aren't on time being too early or late, or their stops are in inconvenient spots where the 20 minute walk would be quicker.

                    We split the problem categories we wanted to focus on into a tracking app, E-bikes, E-scooters, bus stops, and charging stations. I mainly focused on the app, while my teammates focused on the others. I feel that the app is the most important aspect of this project; in a sense, it organizes every element for the user.
